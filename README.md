<strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong>
<br>
Build a weather dashboard with form inputs:
<br>
WHEN I search for a city, I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
<br>
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city, I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
<br>
WHEN I view the UV index, I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
<br>
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city, I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
<br>
WHEN I click on a city in the search history, I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
